# DataScience
Collection of research and learning content for ML and Datascience

1. This is just in first a collection of research and learning for Datascience and ML Engineering. Common use of Framework like Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, Keras etc. some input comes directly from my own online study or playing around with techniques
2. The Idea is to use this as an ongoing Project and build up of code snippets based on Jupyter Notebooks to reuse it whereever you want
3. Further Projects should be startet on this bases...maybe
